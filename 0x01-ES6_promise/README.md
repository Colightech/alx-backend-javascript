# INTRODUCTION:
0x01-ES6_Promise is a crucial feature in modern JavaScript, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), that fundamentally alters how asynchronous operations are handled within the language. Promises provide a cleaner and more organized approach to managing asynchronous code, offering a solution to the long-standing callback hell problem. With the advent of Promises, developers can write asynchronous JavaScript code that is more readable, maintainable, and easier to reason about. In this introduction, we will delve into the core concepts of Promises, explore their syntax, and understand how they revolutionize asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
