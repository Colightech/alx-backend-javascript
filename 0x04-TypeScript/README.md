# introduction:

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It was developed by Microsoft and released in 2012. TypeScript adds optional static typing, classes, interfaces, and other features to JavaScript, making it easier to build large-scale applications by catching errors early in the development process and enabling better tooling support. It has gained significant popularity in the web development community due to its ability to improve code quality and developer productivity.
