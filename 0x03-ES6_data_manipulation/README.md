# Project Name
0x03. ES6 data manipulation

# INTRODUCTION:


0x03, often referred to as "ES6" or "ECMAScript 6," is a significant update to the JavaScript language specification, which introduced various enhancements and new features for data manipulation. ES6, ratified in 2015, revolutionized how developers work with data in JavaScript, offering more concise syntax and powerful tools.

Some of the key features in ES6 for data manipulation include:

Arrow Functions: These provide a more concise syntax for defining functions, making code more readable and expressive, especially when working with arrays and higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce.
Template Literals: Template literals allow for easy interpolation of variables within strings, facilitating dynamic string creation and manipulation.
Destructuring Assignment: This feature enables extracting values from arrays or objects into distinct variables, simplifying data manipulation tasks such as variable assignment, swapping, and function parameters.
Spread Syntax: The spread syntax (...) allows for expanding iterable objects like arrays into individual elements, simplifying tasks such as array concatenation, copying, and function arguments.
Rest Parameters: Similar to spread syntax, rest parameters (...) enable gathering individual function arguments into a single array parameter, providing flexibility when working with variable-length argument lists.
Enhanced Object Literals: ES6 introduced shorthand syntax for defining object properties and methods, making object creation more concise and intuitive.
Array and Object Methods: ES6 added several new methods to the Array and Object prototypes, such as find, findIndex, Object.keys, Object.values, and Object.entries, streamlining common data manipulation tasks.
Map, Set, and WeakMap: ES6 introduced new data structures like Map, Set, and WeakMap, providing alternatives to arrays and objects for storing and manipulating data with unique features and performance characteristics.
